# gridiron

**Playbook as code.** Design American football plays in Python, then render them to
diagrams, practice scripts, call sheets, and wristbands.

Plays are plain data. That means they diff in git, round-trip through JSON, get
generated in loops, and rebuild themselves in CI — instead of living inside a
$900/year cloud subscription that owns your playbook.

```python
from gridiron import adjustments as A
from gridiron.catalog import passing
from gridiron.templates import routes as R

mesh = passing.mesh_concept()
mesh.render().save("mesh.svg")

# Alts are data, not clicks
third_down = mesh.adjust(
    A.PROTECTION("Slide Rt"),
    A.MOTION("Z", "jet"),
    A.TAG("Y", R.CORNER()),
    A.ALERT("Alert Fade vs press"),
)
print(third_down.call)
# Shotgun Trips Right Mesh Concept Slide Rt Z Jet Y Corner
```

## Why

Every football design tool on the market is closed and rented: Hudl Play Tools
($199 on top of a ~$900 video subscription), FirstDown PlayBook (~$60–80/mo),
Pro Quick Draw ($199+/yr), Just Play (enterprise quote). They draw plays well.
None of them let you *program* your playbook, and none of them let you own the file.

The open-source side is nearly empty — one Qt desktop app, and analytics libraries
that read play-by-play data but can't draw a play.

`gridiron` fills that gap, and covers the parts coaches actually spend Sunday
night on: **scripted series, install plans, practice scripts, call sheets, and
wristbands** — generated from the same source of truth so the numbers always agree.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Requires Python 3.10+. Dependencies: `pydantic` and `reportlab` (PDF export).

## The four building blocks

### 1. Formations and plays

```python
from gridiron.catalog import passing, running, redzone
from gridiron.templates import formations as F

iz = running.inside_zone()                              # stock play
iz_gun = running.inside_zone(formation=F.GUN_DOUBLES()) # same concept, new look
smash_left = passing.smash().mirror()
```

Or build your own with the fluent builder:

```python
from gridiron import build_play
from gridiron.templates import routes as R, formations as F
from gridiron.models import PlayType

play = (
    build_play(F.SHOTGUN_TRIPS_RIGHT())
    .block_ol()
    .routes(X=R.FLY(), Y=R.FLAT(), Z=R.MESH(), H=R.MESH(depth=6), RB=R.SWING())
    .name("Mesh").play_type(PlayType.PASS).tag("mesh", "third-down")
    .build()
)
```

### 2. Adjustments — the alts, as data

Every alt is a small serializable object, so a variant is just *base + adjustments*.
It prints itself onto the call sheet and diffs cleanly in git.

```python
from gridiron import adjustments as A

mesh.adjust(A.MOTION("Z", "jet"))          # jet, orbit, across, return, short, out, in
mesh.adjust(A.SHIFT("Y", -7.0, 0.0))       # trade the tight end
mesh.adjust(A.FLIP())                      # mirror; "Right" becomes "Left"
mesh.adjust(A.MAX_PROTECT("RB"))           # keep the back in
mesh.adjust(A.PLAY_ACTION("RB"))           # add the fake, force max protection
mesh.adjust(A.TEMPO("no_huddle"))

# Generate a whole family at once
A.variants(mesh, A.FLIP(), A.MOTION("Z", "jet"), A.MAX_PROTECT())
A.matrix(mesh, [A.FLIP()], [A.MOTION("Z", "jet"), A.MOTION("H", "orbit")])
```

Motion is drawn on the diagram: a dashed trail from the pre-snap alignment,
a ghosted starting position, and the snap position moved for full-speed motions.

### 3. Scripted series — the way offenses are actually built

A base play plus every call that punishes over-reaction to it. Each entry
records the **tell**: what you see that makes it the right call.

```python
from gridiron.series import series
from gridiron.catalog import running, passing

iz = (
    series("Inside Zone Series", "Everything off the same mesh point")
    .base(running.inside_zone(), note="Track the double team")
    .constraint(running.speed_sweep(), tell="Backside LB fast-flowing inside")
    .play_action(passing.y_cross().adjust(A.PLAY_ACTION("RB")),
                 tell="Safeties triggering downhill")
    .shot(passing.four_verticals(), tell="Single high, FS cheating the box")
    .build()
)

print(iz.describe())
iz.install(days=3)          # teaching progression
iz.to_script(reps=2)        # practice script
iz.render_all("out/iz")     # one SVG per play
```

Six stock series ship in `gridiron.catalog.series`.

### 4. Scripts, call sheets, wristbands

```python
from gridiron.script import Script, PracticeScript
from gridiron.callsheet import CallSheet, Wristband
from gridiron.models import situation as S
from gridiron.templates import defense as D

openers = (
    Script(name="Opening 15", opponent="Central")
    .add(passing.mesh_concept(), S.FIRST_TEN, looks=[D.NICKEL_425()])
    .add(running.inside_zone(), S.SECOND_MEDIUM)
    .alternate_hashes()
)
print(openers.table())
print(openers.balance())     # run/pass split, personnel distribution

practice = (
    PracticeScript(name="Tuesday", team="Riverside HS")
    .add_period("Inside Run", iz.to_script(), minutes=12, focus="Zone tracks")
    .add_period("7-on-7", mesh_series.to_script(reps=2), minutes=15)
)

sheet = CallSheet.from_playbook(playbook, name="Week 3").number()
band = Wristband.from_call_sheet(sheet)     # numbers match the call sheet
sheet.save_html("out/call_sheet.html")
band.save_html("out/wristband.html")
```

`Situation` models down, distance, field zone, hash, tempo and clock, so plays
bucket themselves onto the sheet:

```python
S.Situation(down=3, distance=5, yard_line=32).describe()
# '3rd & 5, Opp 32'
S.Situation.own(25)      # ball on our 25
S.Situation.opp(8).zone  # FieldZone.LOW_RED
```

---

## Command line

```bash
gridiron list plays                     # or formations | defenses | routes | series
gridiron render mesh_concept -o out/mesh.svg -d NICKEL_425
gridiron series mesh --out out/mesh_series
gridiron script inside_zone --reps 2 --looks NICKEL_425 FIRE_ZONE --hashes
gridiron callsheet mesh red_zone -o out/week3.html --wristband out/band.html
gridiron demo --out out/demo           # one of everything
```

## Output formats

| Format | How |
|---|---|
| SVG diagram | `play.render().save("play.svg")` |
| PDF playbook (1/2/4-up) | `playbook.save_pdf("book.pdf", plays_per_page=4)` |
| HTML playbook page | `playbook.save_html("book.html")` |
| Call sheet / wristband | `sheet.save_html(...)`, `band.save_html(...)` |
| Practice script | `practice.to_html()`, `practice.save_csv(...)` |
| JSON | `play.to_json()`, `Playbook.load(path)` |

All HTML is single-file and print-ready — no assets, no CDN, no JavaScript.

## Examples

```bash
python examples/inside_zone.py        # build a run play from scratch
python examples/mesh_concept.py       # build a pass concept from scratch
python examples/scripted_series.py    # a series, its install plan, and a script
python examples/game_week.py          # series -> practice -> call sheet -> wristband -> PDF
python examples/redzone_package.py
python examples/export_playbook_pdf.py
```

---

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

The suite checks every stock formation for 11 players and 5 linemen, every
defensive look for 11 defenders, every catalog play for complete assignments and
a clean SVG render, and every adjustment for immutability and JSON round-tripping.

---

## Roadmap

- Flag football (5v5, 7v7) field sizes and formation sets
- Special teams: kickoff, punt, field goal, return units
- Coverage overlays and animated route timing
- Play install/teaching sheets with coaching points per position
- Import from Hudl / Pro Quick Draw exports
- A small web viewer for published playbooks

Contributions welcome — the catalog especially. Adding a play is one function.
